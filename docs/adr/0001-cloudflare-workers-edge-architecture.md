# ADR 0001: Cloudflare Workers Edge-First Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This project requires a global, performant web application for a community website with the following requirements:

- Global audience requiring low latency worldwide
- Blog/CMS functionality with multi-author support  
- Image/media hosting for user-generated content
- Cost-effective hosting solution
- Simple deployment and maintenance
- No initial need for user accounts/authentication

## Decision

We will use Cloudflare Workers as the primary runtime environment with the following stack:

- **Frontend**: Astro v4+ with React components, deployed as Cloudflare Worker
- **Backend**: SonicJS (Workers-native headless CMS)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for media assets
- **Cache**: Cloudflare KV for published content caching
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for resource management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Global Performance**: Workers execute at edge locations worldwide (~100ms latency globally)
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-request model scales from zero
- **Integrated Stack**: All services from single provider reduces complexity
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with Wrangler CLI and local development
- **Automatic Scaling**: No server management or capacity planning needed

### Negative

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling to Cloudflare ecosystem
- **Runtime Limitations**: V8 isolates have constraints vs. traditional servers
- **Limited Ecosystem**: Fewer third-party integrations compared to traditional hosting
- **Cold Start Potential**: Though minimal, can affect first requests

### Neutral

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to adapt to edge-first development patterns
- **Debugging**: Different tooling and approaches needed for distributed applications

## Implementation Notes

- Monorepo structure with separate Workers for frontend and CMS
- D1 database migrations managed through Wrangler CLI
- R2 bucket configured for public read access for media assets
- KV namespace used for caching published content with TTL
- CI/CD pipeline handles infrastructure provisioning and application deployment
