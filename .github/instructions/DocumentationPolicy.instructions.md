when working in a repository, designate a documentation directory to contain architecture decision records, mermaid diagrams, and similar artifacts. Generate and maintain documentation of your work with incremental commits. 

The intention should proceed the action. Generate the documentation changes such as ADRs and commit them *before* making the code changes. 

Work in refinement cycles as necessary committing checkpoints with thinking in progress. It may be necessary to add to, or supercede ADRs as we work. It's important that we capture the design process in detail.
